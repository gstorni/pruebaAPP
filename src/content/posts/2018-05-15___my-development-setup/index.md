In the past, I stumbled upon many interesting tools by investigating the development setups of other developers. Therefore, I thought I could also present you my setup.

I change up things sometimes, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as terminal including [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with [avit theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#avit) and [Roboto Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) as font

## Desktop Apps

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my main browser
* [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) as my note-taking app. It is focused on markdown, snippets, and customization.
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) as my project management tool
* [Any.do](https://web.any.do/) to manage my tasks across devices
* [Enpass](https://enpass.io/) for password management
* [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/) as messaging app

## Notebook

I am using a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) for development and a custom-built desktop PC for gaming.
