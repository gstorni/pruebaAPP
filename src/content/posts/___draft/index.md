This is a draft post. Gatsby will not create a web page for this file.
To publish this post edit name of the folder to `YYYY-MM-DD___slug`

Every post markdown file index.md has its own separate folder. The name of the postâ€™s folder should be consistent with the pattern.

* a post date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD pattern)
* a separator ___ (three underscores)
* a slug (kebab-case or whatever you want)
